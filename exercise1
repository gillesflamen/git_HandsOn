1. Make a new branch called fix and move to it.

# check which branch

git branch

# create the branch fix 

git branch fix

# go to motif 

git checkout motif 


2. Fix the seqClass.py script so that it is able to classify correctly any RNA or DNA sequence.

I adapted these lines:

args.seq = args.seq.upper().strip().replace(" ","")

#here we are seaking for RNA DNA specific nucleotides
if not re.search('^[ACGTU]+$', args.seq):
    print ('The sequence is not DNA nor RNA')
elif 'U' in args.seq and 'T' in args.seq:
    print('The sequence is neither DNA nor RNA')
elif re.search('U', args.seq):
    print ('The sequence is RNA')
elif re.search('T', args.seq):
    print ('The sequence is DNA')
else:
    print ('The sequence can be DNA or RNA')
 

# then I did 
git add seqClass.py

# and commited with a comment about my adjustments
git commit 

3. Merge the fix branch back to master.
git checkout master

git merge fix


4. Make sure you add comments to explain your changes.

5. Stage and commit the changes on master in your local repository.

6. Push your commits on master to your GitHub repository.
    Stage, commit and push your changes in the fix branch to your GitHub repository.
    
git checkout fix

git add exercise1

git commit 

git push origin fix
